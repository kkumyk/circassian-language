### Alphabet page
This page introduces one of the standards used for the Circassian language - the Kabardian and lists the letters and word examples in both, Cyrillic and Latin, accompanied by their sounds.

<img src="doc/features/doc-alphabet.jpg" style="width:698px;"/>

Letters in Cyrillic starting with the same letter in Latin transcription can be highlighted via keyboard. Letters marked up as belonging to one group will change their size and text colour when a corresponding keyboard key is pressed.

## Future Features
Two features are planned for the site:
<ol>
  <li>an option to navigate through the letters groups starting with the same latin letter on the Alphabet page with the keyboard</li>
  <li>an interactive page with a poem in Kabardian that will allow to take user's voice input and compare it with the recording done by a native speaker; the result of this interaction will be a calculated score that will represent the pronunciation accuracy.</li>
</ol>

## Further Improvements
<ul>
<li>style nav bar so that it is clear where you are - on which page</li>
<li>add favicons for sises below:

```
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="assets/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png">

<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="assets/favicon/favicon-32x32.png">
```
</li>

<li>add 404 page</li>
<li>add animation to the hub: the logo text and the text in the circle will be switching to indicate that this is the same text</li>

<li>create and add the remaining images to the alphabet letters</li>

<li>replace special characters with their corresponding unicodes</li>
</ul>
