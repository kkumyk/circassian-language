<ol>
<li>to raise awareness about the challenges this language is currently facing, and</li>
<li>to introduce an interactive alphabet as an alternative to the static alphabet pages available online for this language.</li>
</ol>
This project was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

  <li>an option to navigate through the letters groups starting with the same latin letter on the Alphabet page with the keyboard</li>
  <li>an interactive page with a poem in Kabardian that will allow to take user's voice input and compare it with the recording done by a native speaker; the result of this interaction will be a calculated score that will represent the pronunciation accuracy.</li>
</ol>

## Further Improvements
<ul>
<li>style nav bar so that it is clear where you are - on which page</li>
<li>add favicons for sises below:

```
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="assets/favicon/apple-touch-icon.png">

<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="assets/favicon/favicon-32x32.png">
```
</li>

<li>add 404 page</li>
<li>add animation to the hub: the logo text and the text in the circle will be switching to indicate that this is the same text</li>

<li>create and add the remaining images to the alphabet letters</li>

<li>replace special characters with their corresponding unicodes</li>
</ul>
