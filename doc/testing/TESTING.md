## Further Testing

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome and Firefox.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop and Android phones.


## Accessibility

- The one image on the [Kabardian Alphabet](https://kkumyk.github.io/circassian-language/kabardian-alphabet.html) contains an alt tag. Images for the remaining letters are currently being worked on. Once these are added to the site, they will be supplied with the alt tags.

- [WEBP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) is used for images on the site.
- The site is responsive to different screen sizes.
- Semantic elements used throughout the site.

## Bugs

- There is an extra space on the right site on the [About page](https://kkumyk.github.io/circassian-language/about.html) which should be removed in the later versions.
- Responsiveness for smaller devices needs further adjustments for the [About page](https://kkumyk.github.io/circassian-language/about.html) as the subheading is partly covered by the menu dropdown. Alternatively, the main text can be made fully invisible with JS when the dropdown menu is clicked and re-appear back again after the user clicked on the menu link, see [example on mobile](https://meduza.io/).
